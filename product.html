            <h2 class="listprice">List Price: $15.00</h2>This piece is from 2019, and heavily inspired by the album cover art for "None Shall Pass" by Aesop Rock. It was a hard time for me during those years, and it was nice to have some emotional validation through the songs on that album. Those emotions I dealt with manifested, and took the form of this piece.</article>

Even without the ability to eviscerate you, having this presence that just jeers and jabs at you psychologically that haunts your shadow is pretty scary.</article>

Khorne, his symbol is depicted on the skull, is the chaos god of slaughter, rage, and war. He is commonly depicted as a large behemoth that carries a giant sword and sits atop a throne of skulls, and his followers revel in their carnage while shouting "BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!".</article>
